Sports is one of the biggest revenues generating industry in the world. The major chunk of revenue comes from football. A major league named English Premier League data has been used in this report to predict the betting odds using Machine Learning Algorithm.
Betting is a process of gambling money on the outcome of the event. Millions of dollars of gambling have taken place in matches of EPL, where some bettors lost their money and some of them won the money, but Bookmaker always earn from every bet. Bookmaker is the organisation or person who accepts the bet and sets the betting odds. Bookmaker does not generate the absolute odds rather than (s)he leaves a margin, which gives the lower portion of profit to the bookmaker. 
The main objective of this dissertation is to develop and evaluate the five different Machine Learning Regression Algorithms which are Linear, Ridge, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost to predict the betting odds of outcomes of EPL matches and compare them based on different metrics such as Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error and R-Sqaure. The aim is finding the best method for prediction of the betting odds, this will help the future bettor to predict the betting odds more accurately using a desirable Machine Learning Algorithm without leaving the margin for Bookmaker. 
It is found that XGBoost Regressor provides the best accuracy among all the other methods which justifies the classification
